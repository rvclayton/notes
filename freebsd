to get rid of "> succeeds port" or "? error - origin not found" port-version
messages, do 

  # cd /usr/ports
  # make index
  # portsdb -u

these commands don't appear to be universally effective.

to get information about port or package x, type

  $ pkg_info -xI x
      # -x x is a regular expression matching against names.
      # -I output an index line per port.

or

  $ pkg_version -v -s x
      # -v verbose output
      # -s select names containing the string x

To update ports after a system upgrade, do

  # portupgrade -f ruby
  # rm /var/db/pkg/pkgdb.db
  # portupgrade -f ruby18-bdb
  # rm /var/db/pkg/pkgdb.db /usr/ports/INDEX-*.db
  # portupgrade -af

See www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/updating-upgrading-freebsdupdate.html for

To set things up so non-superusers can mount devices,

To /etc/sysctl.conf add

  vfs.usermount=1

To /etc/devfs.rules add something like

  [localrules=10]
  add path 'da*' mode 0660 group users
  add path 'md*' mode 0660 group users

da* are flash devices and md* are virtual disks.  To /etc/rc.conf add

  devfs_system_ruleset="localrules"

To /etc/devfs.conf add

  # Allow all users to mount the usb devices.
  own   /dev/da0s1  root:operator
  perm  /dev/da0s1  0666

  # Allow all users to mount the cdrom drive.
  own   /dev/cd0  root:operator
  perm  /dev/cd0  0666

Reboot.  Users should be in the operator group, and mount on directories they
own.  Directories owned by root with a+rwx permissions don't work.

To permanently label a disk partition for use in fstab, do

  $ sudo glabel label <label> <filesystem>

then use /dev/label/<label> as the filesystem entry in fstab.  For example

  $ sudo glabel label wd500 /dev/da1s1d

  $ grep wd500 /etc/fstab
  /dev/label/wd500        /mnt/wd/500G    ufs     rw              0       0

  $

See www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/geom-glabel.html

to fix problems with the mouse and keyboard in x, 

  run "make config" in /usr/ports/x11-servers/xorg-server and turn off hal.
  then "make deinstall install clean"

--

Put

  fsck_y_enable="YES"

in /etc/rc.conf to automatically run fsck when unclean file systems are found
during boot-up.  You might also want to try putting

  background_fsck="NO"

in there too.

Mounting loopback:

  # mdconfig -a -t vnode -f /path/to/image.iso -u i	
      : -a attach disk
      : -t disk type 
      : -f disk source 
      : -u unit number

  # mount -t cd9660 /dev/mdi <mnt-dir>
      : -t mount type

  # umount <mnt-dir>

  # mdconfig -d -u i
      : -d detach disk
      : -u unit number

where i is an unused md device number (0, 1, ...)

--

Updating ports:

  $ pkg_version -v -L =		
      : -v verbose output
      : -L skip matching entries

  $ more /usr/ports/UPDATING

  $ sudo pkgdb -Ff
      : -Ff fix held packages too.

  # portupgrade -a
      : -a upgrade all

Don't forget to drop into root for portupgrade; sudo doesn't cut it.

To record a cd:

  $ mkisofs -RJ -o p.iso n
      : -R rock ridge features to support posix metadata
      : -J joliet directories for ms compatibility.
      : -o output filename

  $ sudo cdrecord -eject -v dev=1,0,0 p.iso
      : -v more chatter

use "$ sudo cdrecord -scanbus" to figure out the dev-option argument.

To fix this kind of problem:

  Affected package: libxul-1.9.2.28_1
  Type of problem: mozilla -- multiple vulnerabilities.
  Reference: http://portaudit.FreeBSD.org/[...]

take a look

  # portaudit -Fd

update ports

  # portsnap fetch update

and try again

  # portmaster libxul

If that fails in the same way, do

  # DISABLE_VULNERABILITIES=yes portmaster libxul

--

If the mouse stops working, try

  $ sudo /etc/rc.d/moused restart

to get it going again.

--

If package info is corrupt, try resetting the file permissions:

  # find /var/db/pkg -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
  # find /var/db/pkg -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;

--

To update the ports tree:

  # portsnap fetch update

To update from a cron job, replace "fetch" with "cron".  The update can be done
at some time later than the fetch.

--

  $ mount -t msdosfs /dev/da0s1 /mnt/flash

  $ umount /mnt/flash

Don't forget the type.  Unlike debian, which can figure it out on its own,
freebsd mounts fail if the type isn't specified.

Also, mounts by non-root users should be to mount points owned by the user, and
the user should be in the operator group.

--

If a ports install fails because of a option misconfiguration, re-do the option
selection using the config make command:

  # make config deinstall install clean

Type

  $ make ports

To run mplayer on a full screen video, type

  $ mplayer -vo x11 -xy 0.75 -zoom <video-file>
